# cordova-plugin-firebase
Cordova plugin for Google Firebase

This plugin is under development! The primary goal for this plugin is to implement FCM for cross platform push notifications. Other parts of the SDK will follow later.

Angular implementation is maintained in the [angular-cordova](https://github.com/arnesson/angular-cordova) project ([source](https://github.com/arnesson/angular-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/3rdparty/firebase.js))
